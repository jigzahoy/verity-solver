# Verity Encounter Solver

This project is yet another Destiny 2 Salvation's Edge Verity Encounter solver.

Just a fun mini project to build a solver with Destiny 2 design language.

Most of the user experience is referenced from ninjachicken373's [verity solver](https://www.ninjachicken737.com/verity). I added the challenge mode, **Varied Geometry** to easily dissect the outside shapes.

Built with Astro
